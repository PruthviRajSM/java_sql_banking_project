💾 Database Design
📊 Database Schema
Customers Table
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    age INT NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    contact_number VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL
);
Accounts Table
CREATE TABLE accounts (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT NOT NULL,
    account_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    balance DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
Transactions Table
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    from_account INT,
    to_account INT,
    amount DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,
    type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (from_account) REFERENCES accounts(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (to_account) REFERENCES accounts(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
